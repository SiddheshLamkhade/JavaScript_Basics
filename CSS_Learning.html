    <!--🔴🟠🟡(1) CSS Sizing Units-->
    
    <!--1️⃣ vh and vw units-->
    <p>
        The vh and vw units in CSS are used to set the size of an element relative to the viewport (the visible area of the web page).

        It ranges from 1 to 100.

    </p>

    <!--2️⃣ margin : auto -->
    <p>
        This property sets margin from left and right sides.
        It brings element to center.

        used to center an element horizontally.

        It works by automatically calculating equal margins on the left and right sides, making the element centered.

        for margin: auto to work correctly, the element must have a specified width. 
        
        margin:23px 34px;
        23 is top bottom margin
        34 is left right margin                 f      
    </p>

    <!--🔴🟠🟡(2) Display property-->
    
    <!--1️⃣ Inline and block elements-->
    <p>
        Block elements take up the full width available, even if their content doesn’t require it.
        They always start on a new line.
        e.g.
        div p hq section    
        
        Inline elements only take up as much width as their content requires.
        They do not start on a new line; they appear next to other inline elements.
        you can adjust padding and margins (though only horizontally).
        e.g.
        span a img 
    </p>

    <!--2️⃣ flex-->
    <p>
        justify-content:center
        to align boxes horizontally.
        
        align-items:center
        to align boxes vertically.use when only one row in flex parent of boxes.

        align-content:center 
        if more than one rows of boxes in parent flex then use align-content. i.e. after wrapping we will use this property.

        flex-direction:
        if column then from top to bottom. 
        if row then from right to left.

        flex-wrap:wrap 
        new content will not go out of parent container

        gap :
        gap between rows and columns in grid and flexbox layouts. It's a shorthand for setting row-gap and column-gap. 
        gap: 13px 53px; row gap and column gap 
    </p>
