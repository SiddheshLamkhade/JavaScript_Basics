    <!--

    ðŸ”´prompt()
    In JavaScript, prompt() is used to display a dialog box that prompts the user to input some text. It pauses the script execution until the user provides an input and then returns that input as a string. 
    same as alert but alert() just shows a message and doesn't expect any input. 

    let name = prompt("Enter name : ");

    ðŸ”´Template Literals
    Template literals are a *feature* in JavaScript that provide an easier way to work with *strings*, especially when you need to *include* ..expressions or variables.. *inside them*. They are 
    ...enclosed by backticks (``) instead of single quotes ('') or double quotes ("")...

USECASES âšªMultiline String: 
..........................INPUT
let message = `This is a
multiline string.`;
console.log(message);
..........................OUTPUT
This is a
multiline string.


USECASES âšªString Interpolation:
..........................INPUT
let name = 'John';
let age = 30;
let greeting = `Hello, my name is ${name} and I am ${age} years old.`;
console.log(greeting);
..........................OUTPUT
Hello, my name is John and I am 30 years old.



USECASES âšªExpression Embedding:
..........................INPUT
let a = 5;
let b = 10;
let result = `The sum of ${a} and ${b} is ${a + b}.`;
console.log(result);
..........................OUTPUT
The sum of 5 and 10 is 15.


....................................alert(`The result is ${eval(`${a} ${c} ${b}`)}`);
    ....IN THIS statement....

    Backticks (`)     
    are used for template literals, which allow you to embed expressions inside strings.

    Quotes (' or ") 
    are used for regular strings.......................................................................

    ðŸ”´Use of Eval
    eval is a JavaScript *function* that evaluates a string as JavaScript code.

    let a = 5;
    let b = 10;
    let operation = "+";
    let expression = `${a} ${operation} ${b}`;
    let result = eval(expression);
    console.log(result);  // Output: 15
