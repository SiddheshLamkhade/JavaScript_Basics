        /*1Ô∏è‚É£Callback Function
         A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function.
         Means function can be passed to another function as an argument.
 
         Function Sequence:-
         JavaScript functions are executed in the sequence they are called. Not in the sequence they are defined.
        */
 
        const callbackfun=(arg)=>{console.log(arg)};
        const func=(src,callbackfun)=>{callback("Harry")}; 
        // When you pass a function as an argument, remember not to use parenthesis.
     </script>
 
     <script>
         /*2Ô∏è‚É£Asynchronous functions - setTimeout
         The setTimeout function in JavaScript is used to execute a function or a block of code after a specified amount of time. The delay is measured in milliseconds.
          Syntax:-                    setTimeout(function, delay);
         --function: The code you want to run after the delay.
         --delay: The time in milliseconds (1000 milliseconds = 1 second) after which the function will run.
 
         In the real world, callbacks are most often used with Asynchronous functions.        
         In the example below , myFunction is used as a callback.
         myFunction is passed to setTimeout() as an argument.
         3000 is the number of milliseconds before time-out, so myFunction() will be called after 3 seconds.
         */
 
         setTimeout(myFunction, 3000);  //Asynchronous function
         function myFunction()          //Callback function
         {
             document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "I love You !!";
         }
     </script>
